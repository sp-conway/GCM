GCM

R code for implementing Nosofsky's (1986) GCM 

\n distance.R : function for calculating distance between two stimuli in multidimensional space
\n gcm_pred.R : function for generating predictions from the GCM, for any number of categories with exemplars varying on two dimensions (will eventually generalize it to any # dimensions)
\n similarity.R : function for converting distance to similarity per Nosofsky (1986) & Shepard (1987)
